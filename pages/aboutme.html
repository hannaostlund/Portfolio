    <h3>I'm Hanna. A digital marketing specialist, who loves to design.</h3>
<p class="info-text">
    I enjoy working with technology and design. The mix of art and tech has always interested me. I've been creating digitally since my first experiences with Microsoft Paint, moving on to master areas such as Photoshop and HTML/CSS. I aim to be the link between marketing and IT, merging creative ideas with practical functionality.
